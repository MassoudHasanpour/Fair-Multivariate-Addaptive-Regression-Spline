In this repository, we have added the concept of fairness to Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spiline (MARS) model based on "Friedman, J.H., 1991. Multivariate adaptive regression splines. The annals of statistics, 19(1), pp.1-67.".
We have added a data preprocesing part and modified cost functions of model to achieve a fiar MARS model.
